# Training Plan Viz

Visual tool to create weekly training plans based on D3.js.

## General Idea

Input weekly volume/intensity goals at the top. That will populate the viz below, with total workout "stress" on the left
that you can drag into the weekly view on the right. Once the workout is placed, it'll show rough metrics of stress and 
recovery, which can show when next to do a workout of that type. Then once it's placed you can adjust the volume/intensity
of that workout to fit specific plans.

## TODO

- Include specific vs. general stress?
